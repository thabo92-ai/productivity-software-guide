## Core Philosophy Differences

Before diving into specific features, it's important to understand the fundamental difference between these two platforms:

**Evernote** is primarily a note-taking and web-clipping tool focused on capturing and organizing information from various sources. It excels at being a "second brain" for storing and retrieving information.

## User Interface & Experience

### Notion

Notion uses a block-based editor where each element (text, image, table, etc.) is a block that can be moved, transformed, or nested. This provides incredible flexibility but comes with a learning curve.

**Pros:**

- Clean, modern aesthetic
- Flexible block system
- Consistent experience across platforms

**Cons:**
- Can feel overwhelming to new users

**Cons:**
