# Affiliate Disclosure

## How We Monetize This Site

At Productivity Software Guide, we believe in complete transparency about how we operate. This page explains how we monetize our content while maintaining our commitment to providing honest, unbiased information.

### Affiliate Partnerships

This site contains affiliate links to products and services that we recommend. If you purchase a product or service through our affiliate links, we may receive a commission from the seller at no additional cost to you.

These affiliate partnerships help us maintain and improve this site, allowing us to continue providing comprehensive productivity software comparisons and reviews without charging our readers.

### Our Commitment to You

Despite our affiliate partnerships, we maintain strict editorial independence:

- We only recommend products and services that we genuinely believe provide value
- Our reviews and comparisons are based on thorough research and testing
- We highlight both strengths and limitations of each tool
- Our primary goal is to help you find the right productivity tools for your needs

### How Affiliate Links Work

When you click on an affiliate link on our site and make a purchase, the URL contains a special tracking code that identifies our site as the referrer. The seller then pays us a small commission for the referral.

Important points to understand:

- You never pay more when using our affiliate links
- We don't receive information about who makes purchases through our links
- You're never obligated to use our affiliate links

### Disclosure on Content

Throughout our site, we include disclosure notices on pages that contain affiliate links. These notices are designed to be clear and conspicuous, in accordance with FTC guidelines.

### Questions?
